# EVIDENCE QUALITY & CONFOUNDING
# ============================================

evidence:
  quality: high
  primary_study_type: meta-analysis
  sources:
    - citation: "Hamer & Chida 2008. Walking and primary prevention: meta-analysis"
      year: 2008
      sample_size: 459833
      contribution: "All-cause mortality HR"

    - citation: "Cornelissen & Smart 2013. Exercise training for blood pressure"
      year: 2013
      contribution: "Blood pressure effect sizes"

    - citation: "Kelly et al 2014. Walking on mortality in cohorts"
      year: 2014
      sample_size: 280000
      contribution: "Dose-response relationship"

confounding:
  # Exercise shows strong healthy user bias
  # RCT effects typically 30-50% of observational estimates
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 2.5
    beta: 5.0

  rationale: |
    Walking studies show substantial healthy user bias.
    Sibling comparisons (Hamer & Stamatakis 2012) suggest ~33% causal.
    Device-measured PA studies (Ekelund 2019) show attenuated effects.
    Beta(2.5, 5.0) → mean 33%, 95% CI: 8-65%

# ============================================

mortality:
  # HR ~0.84 from meta-analyses
  # LogNormal(-0.18, 0.08) → median 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.97
  hazard_ratio: LogNormal(-0.18, 0.08)

# ============================================
# QUALITY OF LIFE
# ============================================

quality:

    - dimension: anxiety_depression

# ============================================
# COSTS
# ============================================

costs:
  hours_per_week: Normal(3.5, 0.5)  # 30 min × 7 days
  annual_cost_usd: Normal(0, 50)    # Just shoes
  activity_disutility: Normal(0, 0.01)  # Walking is pleasant for most

# ============================================
# CAVEATS & ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================

caveats:
  - "Benefits may plateau with higher baseline activity"
  - "Effect size assumes currently sedentary individuals"
  - "Hot/cold weather may affect adherence"

profile_adjustments:
  - condition: "age > 70"
    adjustment: "Reduce HR effect by 15% (less mortality headroom)"

  - condition: "baseline_activity == 'active'"
    adjustment: "Reduce HR effect by 50% (diminishing returns)"

  - condition: "bmi > 30"
    adjustment: "Increase weight loss effect by 30%"
