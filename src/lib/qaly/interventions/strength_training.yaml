      year: 2012
      contribution: "Review of mechanisms"

confounding:
  # Strength training shows even stronger healthy user bias than aerobic exercise
  # Those who lift weights tend to be more health-conscious, younger, male
  # Limited RCT data on mortality outcomes
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 2.5
    beta: 6.0

  rationale: |
    Resistance training observational studies show strong healthy user effect.
    Population that lifts weights highly selected for health consciousness.
    Limited long-term RCT data (too expensive, compliance issues).
    Mechanisms well-established but mortality effects uncertain.
    Beta(2.5, 6.0) → mean 29%, 95% CI: 7-61%

# CAVEATS & ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================

caveats:
  - "Requires proper form to avoid injury"
  - "Benefits greatest for sarcopenic individuals"

profile_adjustments:
  - condition: "age > 65"
    adjustment: "Increase muscle mass and bone density benefits by 40% (sarcopenia prevention)"

  - condition: "age > 65"
    adjustment: "Increase fall prevention benefit (20% fall risk reduction)"

  - condition: "diabetes == true"
    adjustment: "Increase insulin sensitivity benefit by 30%"

  - condition: "baseline_strength_training == true"
    adjustment: "Reduce HR effect by 70% (already doing it)"

  - condition: "gender == 'female' AND age > 50"
    adjustment: "Increase bone density benefit by 50% (osteoporosis prevention)"
