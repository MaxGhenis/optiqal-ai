confounding:
  # Sleep studies show strong reverse causation and healthy user bias
  # Mendelian randomization (Daghlas 2019) suggests ~25-40% causal
  # Short sleep often marker of stress, illness, shift work
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 2.0
    beta: 5.5

  rationale: |
    Sleep duration shows U-shaped mortality curve with strong confounding.
    Short sleep often due to stress, illness, shift work (reverse causation).
    Long sleep may be marker of poor health.
    Mendelian randomization studies suggest ~25-35% causal for short sleep.
    Beta(2.0, 5.5) → mean 27%, 95% CI: 6-58%

# MORTALITY EFFECT
# ============================================

mortality:
  # Meta-analysis shows ~HR 1.12 for <6h vs 7-8h sleep
  # Reverse HR (going from short to optimal): ~0.89
  # LogNormal(-0.12, 0.10) → median 0.89, 95% CI: 0.73-1.08
  hazard_ratio: LogNormal(-0.12, 0.10)
  onset_delay: 0.25
  ramp_up: 1.0
  decay_rate: 0

# ============================================
# QUALITY OF LIFE
# ============================================

quality:
  subjective_wellbeing: Normal(0.04, 0.02)

  dimension_effects:
    - dimension: anxiety_depression
      change: Normal(0.03, 0.015)

    - dimension: vitality

    - dimension: cognitive_function
      change: Normal(0.04, 0.02)

# ============================================
# COSTS
# ============================================

costs:
  hours_per_week: Normal(-3.5, 2)  # NEGATIVE: sleep chronically deprived gain time (initially)
  annual_cost_usd: Normal(100, 50)  # Sleep hygiene items (blackout curtains, etc)
  activity_disutility: Normal(0.02, 0.01)  # Opportunity cost of evening activities

# ============================================
# CAVEATS & ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================

caveats:
  - "U-shaped curve: both short and long sleep associated with higher mortality"
  - "Effect size assumes baseline <6.5 hours/night"
  - "Strong reverse causation: illness causes poor sleep"
  - "Individual variation in optimal sleep duration"
  - "Quality matters as much as duration"

profile_adjustments:
  - condition: "baseline_sleep > 7"
    adjustment: "Set HR to 1.0 (already optimal)"

  - condition: "baseline_sleep > 9"
    adjustment: "INCREASE HR to 1.08 (long sleep is harmful marker)"

  - condition: "age > 70"
    adjustment: "Reduce effect by 20% (less sleep needed)"

  - condition: "shift_worker == true"
    adjustment: "Reduce effect by 40% (harder to achieve consistent sleep)"
