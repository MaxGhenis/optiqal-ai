# ============================================

evidence:
  quality: high

      sample_size: 7447
      contribution: "Primary RCT for CVD outcomes"

    - citation: "Sofi F et al. Adherence to Mediterranean diet and health status: meta-analysis. BMJ 2014;337:a1344"

      year: 2017
      contribution: "Mechanism effects"

confounding:
  # RCT evidence (PREDIMED) but strong healthy user effect in observational studies
  # RCT shows ~70% of observational effects are causal
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 6.0
    beta: 2.5

  rationale: |
    PREDIMED RCT shows robust causal effects on CVD endpoints.
    Observational estimates attenuated but RCT confirms large causal component.
    Mendelian randomization studies (Larsson 2020) support causality.
    Beta(6.0, 2.5) → mean 71%, 95% CI: 42-90%

# ============================================
# CAVEATS & ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================

caveats:
  - "Requires food access and cooking skills"
  - "Cultural adaptation may affect adherence"
  - "Benefits greatest in those with baseline poor diet"
  - "Cost can be barrier in low-income populations"

profile_adjustments:
  - condition: "baseline_diet == 'healthy'"
    adjustment: "Reduce HR effect by 60% (diminishing returns)"

  - condition: "cvd_risk == 'high'"
    adjustment: "Increase CVD pathway weight to 0.70"

  - condition: "age > 65"
    adjustment: "Increase effect magnitude by 10% (higher absolute risk)"
