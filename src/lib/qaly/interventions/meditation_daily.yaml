# EVIDENCE QUALITY & CONFOUNDING
# ============================================

evidence:
  quality: moderate
  primary_study_type: meta-analysis
  sources:
    - citation: "Goyal M et al. Meditation programs for psychological stress and well-being. JAMA Intern Med 2014;174:357-68"
      year: 2014
      sample_size: 3515
      contribution: "Meta-analysis of RCTs for anxiety/depression"

    - citation: "Creswell JD et al. Mindfulness-based stress reduction training reduces loneliness and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Brain Behav Immun 2016;56:165-72"

      sample_size: 40
      contribution: "RCT showing inflammation effects"

    - citation: "Black DS & Slavich GM. Mindfulness meditation and immune function. Ann NY Acad Sci 2016;1373:13-24"
      year: 2016
      contribution: "Review of immune/inflammatory mechanisms"

confounding:
  # Meditation practitioners show strong selection effects
  # Those who meditate regularly differ in many ways (educated, health-conscious, low stress baseline?)
  # RCT evidence exists but limited follow-up, high dropout
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 4.0
    beta: 4.0

  rationale: |
    Meditation RCTs show consistent effects on stress/anxiety (moderate size).
    Selection bias: regular meditators likely differ in baseline characteristics.
    RCT evidence moderate quality (short follow-up, high dropout rates).
    Mechanisms plausible (HPA axis, inflammatory pathways).
    Beta(4.0, 4.0) → mean 50%, 95% CI: 21-79%

# ============================================
# CAVEATS & ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================

caveats:
  - "Requires consistent practice for sustained benefits"
  - "Benefits strongest for those with high baseline stress/anxiety"
  - "High dropout rates in practice (adherence challenge)"
  - "Quality of practice matters (guided vs self-directed)"
  - "May not be suitable for active psychosis or severe trauma"

profile_adjustments:
  - condition: "anxiety_disorder == true OR depression == true"
    adjustment: "Increase mental health QoL benefit by 50%"

  - condition: "chronic_pain == true"
    adjustment: "Increase pain dimension benefit by 60%"

  - condition: "hypertension == true"
    adjustment: "Increase BP effect by 30%"

  - condition: "baseline_stress == 'low'"
    adjustment: "Reduce all effects by 40% (ceiling effect)"
