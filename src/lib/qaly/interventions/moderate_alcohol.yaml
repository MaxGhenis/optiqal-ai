# EVIDENCE QUALITY & CONFOUNDING

evidence:
  quality: moderate
  primary_study_type: meta-analysis

      contribution: "Mendelian randomization questioning J-curve"

confounding:
  # Alcohol shows strong confounding - the "J-curve" largely artifact
  # Mendelian randomization (Holmes 2014, Millwood 2019) shows linear harm
  # Abstainers include sick quitters (reverse causation)
  # Light drinkers tend to be healthier, wealthier
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 2.0
    beta: 6.0

  rationale: |
    Observational studies show J-curve (benefit at 1-2 drinks/day).
    Mendelian randomization studies (Holmes 2014, Millwood 2019) show:
    - No cardioprotective effect
    - Linear increase in BP, stroke risk with any alcohol
    Confounding by abstainer characteristics (sick quitters, religious).
    Benefits largely artifact. Harm reduction is real benefit.
    Beta(2.0, 6.0) → mean 25%, 95% CI: 5-56%

# ============================================
# MORTALITY EFFECT
# ============================================

mortality:
  # Effect is harm REDUCTION from heavy drinking (>3 drinks/day) to moderate
  # Heavy drinking HR ~1.3-1.5, moderate ~1.0-1.1
  # Reduction to light/none: HR ~0.85 vs continuing heavy
  # LogNormal(-0.16, 0.12) → median 0.85, 95% CI: 0.67-1.08
  hazard_ratio: LogNormal(-0.16, 0.12)
  onset_delay: 0.25
  ramp_up: 1.0
  decay_rate: 0

# QUALITY OF LIFE

# ============================================
# COSTS
# ============================================

costs:
  hours_per_week: Normal(0.5, 0.5)  # Some effort to change habits

  activity_disutility: Normal(0.01, 0.01)  # Social adjustment, some miss drinking

# ============================================
# CAVEATS & ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================

caveats:
  - "Effect assumes reduction FROM heavy/moderate drinking (>2-3 drinks/day)"
  - "Never-drinkers should NOT start drinking for health"
  - "J-curve in observational data likely confounded"
  - "Mendelian randomization suggests no safe level"
  - "Benefits are harm reduction, not true health improvement"
  - "Individual variation in alcohol metabolism (e.g., ALDH2 variants)"

profile_adjustments:
  - condition: "baseline_alcohol == 'none'"
    adjustment: "Set HR to 1.0 (no benefit from staying abstinent vs starting light drinking)"

  - condition: "baseline_alcohol == 'light'"
    adjustment: "Set HR to 0.98 (minimal change)"

  - condition: "baseline_alcohol == 'heavy'"
    adjustment: "Increase benefit by 40% (larger reduction)"

  - condition: "liver_disease == true"
    adjustment: "Increase liver pathway benefit by 100%"

  - condition: "family_history_alcoholism == true"
    adjustment: "Increase QoL benefit by 30% (avoid addiction risk)"
