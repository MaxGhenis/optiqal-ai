confounding:
  # Smoking cessation has high causal evidence
  # Minimal healthy user bias (smokers who quit similar to continuing smokers)
  # Dose-response very strong, reversibility supports causation
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 9.0
    beta: 1.0

  rationale: |
    Smoking causation extremely well-established through:
    - Dose-response (pack-years)
    - Temporality (reversal of risk after cessation)
    - Biological plausibility (multiple mechanisms)
    - Animal models and biochemical evidence
    Confounding minimal due to strong causal evidence.
    Beta(9.0, 1.0) → mean 90%, 95% CI: 71-99%

# ============================================
# MORTALITY EFFECT
# ============================================

mortality:
  # Current smokers HR ~2.8 vs never smokers
  # Cessation brings HR from 2.8 → ~1.6 (quit age 40-50)
  # Relative reduction ~0.57, but vs continuing smoking ~0.57
  # After 15+ years, approaches never-smoker risk
  # LogNormal(-0.51, 0.12) → median 0.60, 95% CI: 0.47-0.76
  hazard_ratio: LogNormal(-0.51, 0.12)
  onset_delay: 0  # Benefits start immediately
  ramp_up: 5.0   # Full benefits take 5-15 years
  decay_rate: 0

# ============================================
# QUALITY OF LIFE
# ============================================

quality:
  subjective_wellbeing: Normal(0.04, 0.02)

  dimension_effects:
    - dimension: anxiety_depression
      change: Normal(0.02, 0.015)  # Withdrawal initially negative, then positive

# ============================================
# COSTS
# ============================================

costs:
  hours_per_week: Normal(1, 0.5)  # Cessation support, managing cravings
  annual_cost_usd: Normal(-2500, 500)  # NEGATIVE: save money from not buying cigarettes (~$7/pack × 365)
  activity_disutility: Normal(0.03, 0.02)  # Withdrawal and cravings (first 3-6 months)

# ============================================
# CAVEATS & ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================

caveats:
  - "Benefits increase with duration of abstinence"
  - "Earlier cessation (younger age) yields greater benefit"
  - "Initial withdrawal period has negative QoL impact"
  - "Requires sustained abstinence for full benefit"
  - "May require pharmacotherapy or behavioral support"
  - "Weight gain common (5-10 lbs average)"

profile_adjustments:
  - condition: "quit_age < 35"
    adjustment: "Increase benefit by 30% (nearly eliminate excess mortality)"

  - condition: "quit_age > 60"
    adjustment: "Reduce benefit by 25% (less time to benefit, more damage done)"

  - condition: "pack_years > 30"
    adjustment: "Reduce lung cancer benefit by 20% (irreversible damage)"

  - condition: "copd_present == true"
    adjustment: "Increase respiratory pathway benefit by 40%"
