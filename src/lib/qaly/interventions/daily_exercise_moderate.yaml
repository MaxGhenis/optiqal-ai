confounding:
  # Exercise shows strong healthy user bias, similar to walking
  # Device-measured PA (Ekelund 2019) shows ~40% of observational effect
  # RCT effects typically 30-50% of observational
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 3.0
    beta: 5.0

  rationale: |
    Exercise studies show substantial healthy user effect.
    Those who exercise differ in many unmeasured ways (diet, stress, genetics).
    Device-measured PA studies show attenuated effects vs self-report.
    RCTs limited by short duration but support causality.
    Beta(3.0, 5.0) → mean 38%, 95% CI: 11-70%

# ============================================
# CAVEATS & ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================

caveats:
  - "Effect assumes currently sedentary baseline (<30 min/week)"
  - "Dose-response: more exercise = greater benefit (up to ~300 min/week)"
  - "Benefits plateau above 300-400 min/week"
  - "Vigorous activity can achieve similar benefits in less time"
  - "Injury risk increases with intensity and volume"

profile_adjustments:
  - condition: "baseline_activity == 'sedentary'"
    adjustment: "Use full effect"

  - condition: "baseline_activity == 'moderate'"
    adjustment: "Reduce HR effect by 60% (already partially active)"

  - condition: "baseline_activity == 'active'"
    adjustment: "Reduce HR effect by 80% (diminishing returns)"

  - condition: "age > 70"
    adjustment: "Reduce HR effect by 20%, increase mobility benefit by 30%"

  - condition: "bmi > 30"
    adjustment: "Increase adiposity effect by 40%"
