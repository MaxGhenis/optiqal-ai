    - citation: "Green AC et al. Reduced melanoma after regular sunscreen use. J Clin Oncol 2011;29(3):257-63"

# Confounding prior - RCT evidence so high causal fraction expected
confounding:
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 8.0  # High confidence in causality (RCT evidence)
    beta: 2.0   # Mean ~0.80 causal fraction
  rationale: "RCT evidence with 15-year follow-up supports high causal fraction"

# Effects work through CONDITIONS, not direct mortality
quality:
  condition_effects:
    # Melanoma: HR 0.50 from Green 2011 RCT
    - condition: melanoma
      incidence_rr: LogNormal(-0.69, 0.37)  # log(0.50), SE from CI 0.24-1.02
    # Non-melanoma skin cancer: HR 0.60 from van der Pols 2006
    - condition: non_melanoma_skin_cancer
      incidence_rr: LogNormal(-0.51, 0.20)  # log(0.60), estimated SE

  # Small direct wellbeing effect (skin protection, reduced sunburn)
  subjective_wellbeing: Normal(0.005, 0.002)

# Mortality effect is DERIVED from condition effects
# The system should calculate this from:
#   Σ (condition incidence reduction × condition mortality rate)
# But we include for backwards compatibility
mortality:
  hazard_ratio: LogNormal(-0.02, 0.15)
  affected_causes:
    - melanoma
    - non_melanoma_skin_cancer

# Time/cost burden
costs:
  hours_per_week: Normal(0.5, 0.2)  # ~4 min/day application
  annual_cost_usd: Normal(150, 50)  # Sunscreen products

caveats:
  - "Effect size may vary by baseline UV exposure and skin type"
  - "Compliance in RCT was monitored; real-world adherence may be lower"
  - "SPF 30+ required; lower SPF may have reduced efficacy"
