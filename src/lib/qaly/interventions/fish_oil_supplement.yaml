      contribution: "Cochrane systematic review"

confounding:
  # RCT evidence available, so confounding should be minimal
  # However, large RCTs (VITAL, Cochrane) show null/small effects
  # Observational studies showed larger benefits (likely confounded)
  prior:
    type: beta
    alpha: 7.0
    beta: 2.0

  rationale: |
    Multiple large RCTs now available (VITAL, REDUCE-IT, Cochrane review).
    Early observational studies showed larger benefits (healthy user bias).
    RCTs show null to small effects in general population.
    REDUCE-IT showed benefit but used high-dose purified EPA (4g/day).
    Standard dose fish oil (1g EPA+DHA) shows minimal CV benefit.
    Beta(7.0, 2.0) → mean 78%, 95% CI: 50-94%

  # Small potential benefit for CV death: HR ~0.92-0.95

# ============================================
# CAVEATS & ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================

caveats:
  - "Large RCTs (VITAL) show minimal benefit in general population"
  - "Benefits may be greater in those with low dietary fish intake"
  - "High-dose EPA (4g REDUCE-IT) shows benefit but is prescription, costly"
  - "Standard 1g dose has minimal mortality benefit based on RCT evidence"
  - "May increase bleeding risk in those on anticoagulants"
  - "Dietary fish consumption preferred over supplements"
  - "Quality varies by brand (oxidation, contamination)"

profile_adjustments:
  - condition: "dietary_fish == 'high'"
    adjustment: "Reduce all effects by 70% (already adequate omega-3 intake)"

  - condition: "triglycerides > 200"
    adjustment: "Increase triglyceride effect by 50%"

  - condition: "heart_disease == true"
    adjustment: "Increase mortality benefit to HR 0.91 (secondary prevention)"

  - condition: "on_anticoagulants == true"
    adjustment: "Add bleeding risk consideration, reduce net benefit"

  - condition: "vegan_vegetarian == true"
    adjustment: "Consider algae-based DHA/EPA as alternative source"
