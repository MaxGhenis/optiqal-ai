{"id":"optiqal-ai-ftn","title":"Add food/supplement category with nut interventions","description":"Precomputed interventions have exercise, diet patterns, sleep, substances, medical, stress. Missing: specific foods (nuts, fish, berries), supplements. Add at minimum: daily_nut_consumption, walnut_consumption, fish_twice_weekly.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-19T21:19:59.164273-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-22T14:51:56.559166-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-22T14:51:56.559166-08:00"}

Current system handles 'do X vs don't do X' but not 'X instead of Y'. Should surface: (1) both are good, (2) difference is small (~0.5 QALYs), (3) compliance matters more than the marginal difference.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-19T21:19:57.714459-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-22T14:53:59.233058-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-22T14:53:59.233058-08:00"}
{"id":"optiqal-ai-vxj","title":"Add explicit prior specification for intervention categories","description":"When analyzing novel interventions, the system should use category-level priors. E.g., for any nut, prior should be ~20% mortality reduction (based on meta-analyses of nuts generally). The prior dominates when nut-specific evidence is sparse. Need to formalize prior specification per category.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-19T21:19:56.664402-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T20:02:23.459864-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T20:02:23.459864-08:00"}
{"id":"optiqal-ai-zeg","title":"Improve Bayesian reasoning: evidence quality affects CI width, not point estimate","description":"Case study: Comparing nut health effects showed that sparse evidence (macadamias) shouldn't lower point estimates, only widen CIs. Currently the system may penalize interventions with less research. Fix: evidenceQuality should affect simulation variance, not the central tendency of mechanism effects.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-19T21:19:55.285242-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-22T14:49:42.238688-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-22T14:49:42.238688-08:00"}
